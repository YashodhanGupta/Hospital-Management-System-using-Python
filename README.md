# Pharmacy-Management-System-using-Python

Hi folks, This is basically a Pharmacy management system project in python using MySql Connectivity.
1). Make sure you have created a database of any name and created a table with the attributes same as shown in image("Pharmacy_attributes.png").
2). Also make sure to replace the credentials and database_name on line_229.
3). Just simply run the hospital.py file.

If you have any query, just drop a mail to- yashodhan1273@gmail.com

Thanks :)
